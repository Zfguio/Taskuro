Taskuro is a work-in-progress task management app tailored for small businesses. Inspired by tools like Jira, it's focused on simplicity, offline use, and storing everything locally on your device — no accounts, no cloud, just you and your tasks.

⚠️ Early development stage — only the login page exists for now, but core ideas and UI may change rapidly. (Honestly, even login might get scrapped — local-only makes it kind of pointless.)

🎯 What Is Taskuro?
A lightweight way for small teams to:

Create and manage tasks

Assign responsibilities

Track work statuses and priorities

Operate entirely offline

Possibly support optional paid cloud sync in the future

🧪 Current State
Right now, development is in its infancy. Just getting started — UI, features, and even architecture may shift a lot as it takes shape.

🛠️ Planned Stack
Framework: .NET MAUI (for cross-platform UI)

Storage: Local SQL database

Platform: Android-first

🔮 Ideas for the Future
Task boards with drag-and-drop

Categories, labels, and filters

Optional user roles (if login stays)

Cloud backup/sync (paid feature down the line)
